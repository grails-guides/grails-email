____
Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. It is a reliable, cost-effective service for businesses of all sizes that use email to keep in contact with their customers.
____

There is a http://plugins.grails.org/plugin/agorapulse/aws-sdk-ses[AWS SDK SES Grails plugin]. However, in this guide we are going to integrate AWS SDK SES directly.

Add a dependency to AWS SES SDK:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=awsses]
----

Also, add configuration properties which can be passed via system properties / command line arguments:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=awsses]
----

Create one service which encapsulates the integration with SES. There are several way to provide programmatic credentials.

____
The client searches for credentials using the default credentials provider chain, in the following order:

In the Java system properties: aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey.

In system environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

In the default credentials file (the location of this file varies by platform).

In the Amazon ECS environment variable: AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI.

In the instance profile credentials, which exist within the instance metadata associated with the IAM role for the EC2 instance.
