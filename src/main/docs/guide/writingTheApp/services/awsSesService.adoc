It is a reliable, cost-effective service for businesses of all sizes that use email to keep in contact with their customers.

There is a http://plugins.grails.org/plugin/agorapulse/aws-sdk-ses[AWS SDK SES Grails plugin]. However, in this guide we are going to integrate AWS SDK SES directly.

Add a dependency to AWS SES SDK:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=awsses]
----

Add configuration properties which can be passed via system properties / command line arguments:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=awsses]
----

Create one service which encapsulates the integration with SES:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/example/grails/AwsSesMailService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/AwsSesMailService.groovy[]
----
